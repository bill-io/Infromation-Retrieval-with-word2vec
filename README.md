Word2Vec Model Training and Elasticsearch Indexing  
This code demonstrates how to create an Elasticsearch index, train a Word2Vec model on text documents, and search for documents using an English analyzer. Follow the steps below to use this code:


Pre-requirements:
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

  ->elasticsearch
  ->gensim
Ensure that Elasticsearch is running locally on http://localhost:9200/ or adjust the URL accordingly in the code.

Overview
This code presents a step-by-step guide for setting up Elasticsearch indexing and training a Word2Vec model to facilitate document retrieval. It encompasses the following key tasks:

1) Elasticsearch Index Creation: The code starts by creating an Elasticsearch index configured with an English text analysis pipeline. This pipeline involves tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and other linguistic processing steps to   enhance text search accuracy.

2) Document Indexing: After defining the index, the code indexes a collection of text documents. It extracts content from these documents, assigns unique identifiers, and stores them in the Elasticsearch index. This step prepares the corpus for efficient retrieval.

3) Word2Vec Model Training: Next, the code trains a Word2Vec model using the indexed documents. The model captures semantic relationships between words, which can later be used to expand search queries and find documents with similar content.

4) Search Implementation: The code performs document searches using a combination of Elasticsearch and the trained Word2Vec model. It analyzes user-provided search queries, expands them by finding similar words in the model's vocabulary, and then uses the Elasticsearch index to retrieve relevant documents based on the expanded queries.
